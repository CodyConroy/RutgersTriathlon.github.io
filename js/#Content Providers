#Content Providers

###Introduction

- Create a URI, then you can simply call delete
- Glorified URI matcher

###Why this approach?

- Restructuring the db will break the client if the client depends on a certain structure
- Hiccup
	- More restful
	- UI and persistence can evolve at the same time

###Use Cases

- Prototype Apps
	- Start with in memory models and then switch over
- Medium Sized Apps
	- Parallelize work in the UI and the backend
- Platform Apps
	- Cross versioning

#Thoughts on Two ORMs

- Cupboard
	- Pros : wrapper around SQLite, POJOs, Converters, Migrations
	- Cons : Batch Support , No Relationships , Repo activity

- Realm
	- Pros : Clean builder-type API, Cross platform
	- Cons : API broken, getter and setters required , Performance is bad, no content provider support

#Color Correction OpenGL on Android
- Apply processing to each individual pixel, pixels are not dependant on each other

###How do you do this on Android?
- Apply a colorFilter : Costly, due to each pixel is perform sequentially
- Apply a RenderScript : Push the bitmap from the CPU to the GPU, costly if doing video
- Open GL ES : Decoder can code directly to the GPU from the CPU is faster
