	<p>Generally, our bike rides are outside during the warmer months, but during the winter we also do trainer rides at the <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/pMj3UqQC9G72">Livingston Recreation Center</a>.</p>
  <p>If you're new to biking, the following is a set of guidelines and required and optional items for a bike ride.</p>

  <h3><b>Required items</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Bike</b> - Road bikes are the norm with some TT bikes on the team. Beginners can opt for a mountain bike or a hybrid too!</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Helmet</b> - Protect that Rutgers educated brain!</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Cycling Kit</b> - Suited for the weather with nifty back pockets to hold snacks.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Water bottles</b> - Helps you stay hydrated during the ride! Make sure your bike has bottle racks.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Cellphone</b> - In the event you get lost, emergency, or bike flats/maintenance issues, give a good buddy a call.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Spare Tubes</b> - If you get a flat ~15 mi from home, you'll need to change it. Flats happen, bring two</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Pump or CO<sub>2<sub> with adapter</b> - Once you change the tube, you'll need to inflate it with these great tools</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Tire Levers</b> - Necessary tools for removing the tire while changing a flat. Two is recommended</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Multi-tool</b> - Convenient arrangement of allen keys, wrenches and a chain tool. If something feels loose during your ride, can be used to make an adjustment</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Cash/Credit Card/Wallet</b> - Great for the inevitable moments when you run out of snacks or hydration.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Identification</b> - Driver's license, RoadID, etc are always a good idea to keep on you in the event of a serious accident. Stay safe!</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Keys</b> - Don't get locked out!</p></li>
  </ul>
</br>
  <h3><b>Optional Items</b></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Swim Cap</b> - Helps reduce drag, minimizes contact between your hair and chlorine, keeps hair out of your face and makes you look super cool.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Swim Buoy</b> - These are used for pulling drills and are available for our use at the pool.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Kickboard</b> - Used for kicking drills / sets and are available for our use at the pool.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Fins</b> - We recommend using shorter fins as opposed to diving fins. These are great for drills and can help improve ankle flexibility for kicking.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Paddles</b> - Can be used for pulling drills or pull strengthening.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Watch</b> - Useful for keeping track of splits, distance, etc.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Waterproof Sandals</b> - Protect your feet from the wet floor / keep day shoes dry.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Lock</b> - Useful for the lockers at any gym. Front desk will have some, but they do run out. Keep your valuables safe!</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Wetsuit</b> - Keeps you warm in the cold Atlantic ocean and helps you float to boot. Swim once in a pool before race day!</p></li>
  </ul>
