      <p> A new semester has arrived, and we're just racin' in crustacean nation! We had an awesome time
          at the Lobsterman Triathlon this year! It was a very long
          drive, but it was worth it. Outstanding racing conditions,
          and Cody was even able to fly his drone around for a little
          bit! Check out the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhH0zDORoQ4">

          <p>Hot, crampy and swampy (despite no swim!) race at USAT Collegiate Club Nationals in Tuscaloosa, Alabama! Thank you Tuscaloosa for being a great host and letting us swarm your city! Our 8 Rutgers Triathletes had an amazing day conquering the duathlon course. Our team placed 98th in the Combined Overall competition with our Men's team at 92nd and our Women's team at 86th. <a href ="https://www.teamusa.org/usa-triathlon/events/national-championships/2018/2018-collegiate-club-national-championships/results">Full results here!</a></p></br>

    <p>Our athletes swam, biked and ran through the Werblin Recreation Center! We had a great group of triathletes, a few beginners and a few veterans. We hope everyone enjoyed their morning with the Rutgers Triathlon Team and hope to see you next year! Congratulations to all of our amazing athletes!</p></br>
