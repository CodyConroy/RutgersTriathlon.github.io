              <p>Hey, I'm Kyle Boehme. President of the Rutgers Triathlon Team. I began my triathlon career just before my freshman year and love the leadership roles that I have taken on with this team. Over the years I have gathered a lot of ideas and technique tips that I will happily share, to help you become a better swimmer, biker, or runner. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about the team!</p>

              <p>Hi! I'm Olivia a junior and the Treasurer for the Triathlon Team. This is my third year on the team and love every second of it, especially when we play sharks and minos instead of practicing. This coming year I'm hoping to get fast and strong enough to beat our prez Kyle at Nationals! Come out to practices and get fast with me!</p>

              <p>My name is Michael Rivero and I am the Design Manager for the Rutgers University Triathlon Club. I am currently a Junior pursuing a major in the Arts with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I swam for three years in high school and needed to compete in one way or another once I entered this University. During the summer before my junior year I decided to jump into triathlon and fell in love with the sport, so I joined the club when the semester began and havenâ€™t looked back!</p>

              <p>Liz is a junior studying mechanical engineering. She joined the team the summer before freshman year and has served as both the Clothing/Design Manager and the Fundraising Director. With the team she has completed a sprint distance triathlon, an Olympic distance triathlon, and an open-water mile. Her least hated part of the race is always the swim. She hopes to race more in the future and improve on her run and bike.</p>

              <p>Hey I'm Sarah! Ran cross country and track throughout high school with minimal bike and swim experience. At the involvement fair looking for a running group to join and somehow stumbled upon the team and decided to check them out. Seemed intimidating at first, not knowing a single person, but everyone's so welcoming and full of passion it was hard not to love the team. Joined Fall 2014 and decided to buy a bike that spring. Began racing Summer 2015. Raced 3 sprints and 6 olympics so far and still counting.</p>

              <p>Hello! I'm Raymond and I'm a Ph.D. student in the Materials Science & Engineering department. I first got into triathlon in Austin, Texas which has a thriving triathlon culture. After getting over the shock, I eventually got used to the demand of multisport training and have raced several triathlons so far. Once getting to Rutgers, I couldn't resist joining the Rutgers Triathlon Team and their welcoming and encouraging members!</p>
