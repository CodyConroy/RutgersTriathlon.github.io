    <h2>Race Results</h2>
	  <p>On September 29th, Rutgers Triathlon traveled to Rye, NY, and competed in the NECTC Conference Championships, Westchester Olympic Triathlon.  After a salty swim, hilly bike, and a tough run, Rutgers managed to score enough points to place 6th at the race, and 7th for the season in the Conference.  As a result, Rutgers has secured a spot at Collegiate Nationals this Spring in Tempe, AZ.  Congratulations to all who raced!:
