    	<p>Generally, our bike rides are outside during the warmer months, but during the winter we also do trainer rides at the <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/pMj3UqQC9G72">Livingston Recreation Center</a>.</p>
      <p>If you're new to biking, the following is a set of guidelines and required and optional items for a bike ride.</p>

      <h3><b>Do before every ride!</b></h3>
      <p>ABC Bike Checklist - </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Air</b> - Check the <b>a</b>ir pressure in your tires and ensure they are inflated to the correct pressure</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Brakes</b> - Ensure your <b>b</b>rakes are in working order and not worn out. Test the brakes that they actually slow you down</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Chain</b> - Examine your <b>c</b>hain for any damage or debris and confirm it is clean and lubricated</p></li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <p>Check the weather! Ride when it's dry and avoid severe windy conditions</p>


      <h3><b>Required items</b></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Bike</b> - Road bikes are the norm with some TT bikes on the team. Beginners can opt for a mountain bike or a hybrid too!</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Helmet</b> - Protect that Rutgers educated brain!</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cycling Kit</b> - Suited for the weather with nifty back pockets to hold snacks.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Water bottle(s)</b> - Helps you stay hydrated during the ride! Make sure your bike has bottle racks.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Snacks</b> - If you're planning to ride for more than an hour, bring some snacks!</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cellphone</b> - In the event you get lost, emergency, or bike flats/maintenance issues, give a good buddy a call.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Spare Tubes</b> - If you get a flat ~25 mi from home, you'll need to change it. Flats happen, bring two of these.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Pump or CO<sub>2</sub> with adapter</b> - Once you change the tube, you'll need to inflate it with these great tools</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Tire Levers</b> - Necessary tools for removing the tire while changing a flat. Two is recommended</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Multi-tool</b> - Convenient arrangement of allen keys, wrenches and a chain tool. If something feels loose during your ride, can be used to make an adjustment</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cash/Credit Card/Wallet</b> - Great for the inevitable moments when you run out of snacks or hydration.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Identification</b> - Driver's license, RoadID, etc are always a good idea to keep on you in the event of a serious accident. Stay safe!</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Keys</b> - Don't get locked out from your car or house!</p></li>
    </ul>
    </br>
      <h3><b>Optional Items</b></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Saddle Bag</b> - Highly recommeded, but technically optional. Can be attached to the back of your seat or on your top tube. Great place to keep spare tubes, CO<sub>2</sub> cartridges, snacks, $20 for emergencies, etc.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cycling clipless (clip in) pedals</b> - Improves the power transfer efficiency from your legs to the bike. Makes you go faster! (Everyone falls once)</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cycling cleats & shoes</b> - These are used to clip your legs into the pedals. Cleats will eventually wear out.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Light Jacket</b> - Useful in case it rains or gets cold</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cycling Gloves</b> - Acts as pads for your hands on the handlebars and can help protect your hands in the event of a crash</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Sunglasses</b> - Protects your eyes from wind and dust and other debris and keep you looking fresh.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cycling Computer & Sensors</b> - Attached to your bike. Appropriate sensors can be connected to measure cadence, speed and distance.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Watch</b> - Useful for keeping track of splits, distance, etc. (If it's not on Strava, did you actually bike?)</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Bike Lock</b> - Can be useful if you stop somewhere and you can't bring your bike in / no one to watch the bikes.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Lights</b> - Blinking lights are always a great idea if you're biking at night. Alternatively, don't bike at night; stay safe!</p></li>
      </ul>
